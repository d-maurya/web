# About me
I am currently an MS (Reasearch) scholar under the guidance of <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/"> Prof. Balaraman Ravindran</a> and <a href="http://www.che.iitm.ac.in/~naras/"> Prof. Shankar Narasimhan</a> at <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/"> CSE department, IIT Madras</a> . My research interests revolve around various machine learning problems. My current work is concentrated on analyzing hypergraphs by using tensor based representation. 

Some of my other works are concentrated on system identification based on matrix factorization methods such as PCA or generalized spectral decomposition. I am fortunate to collaborate with <a href="http://arunkt.wixsite.com/homepage"> Prof. Arun K. Tangirala</a>, <a href="http://www.che.iitm.ac.in/~naras/"> Prof. Shankar Narasimhan</a> and <a href="https://web.iitm.ac.in/ibse/team/Raghunathan-Rengaswamy.html"> Prof. Raghunathan Rengaswamy</a> for this work.
